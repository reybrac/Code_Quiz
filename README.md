## General Info

Creating a Code Quiz utilizing Javascript, CSS, and HTML. 

This exersize further helped improve Javascript knowledge and utilize many of the various functions. 

There were several hurdles with creating the code quiz. Started with showing a single question on the screen. It took research to determine how to setup the timer and cycle through questions. 
1. Setting up the transitions between questions was a challenge. 
2. Tried to setup a set of variable for the questions, choices, and answers without success. Was able to make it work by utilizing an object that contained the information.
3. Tried sending information local storage, but only one value would save at a time. 
4. Ended up using a "for" loop and correctly setting/getting the information from the local storage to correctly show highscores. 
5. It was a challenging activity, but thrilled to have completed the page.

##### Future_scope
Future scope would be to add an API to a trivia site and ramdomize the questions. This would improve the game and make it funner for the user.
